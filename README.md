Question 1 - The Castle Company is answered in package "theCastleCompany" etc. 

Some assumptions i made in theTransformationCompany are below 
- user input team, player and scores per player property via a console. Program start by requesting you for teams information, then players information. From this the object used in the game are created. 
- When exit the game due to a tie, a statement is printed on the screen. i.e "game ends due to tie in battle" 
- properties for players such as strenght etc. cannot be more than 10 or less than one, if user input a value more than this. program default it to 1. this is made clear to users at start of program 
- when sorting fighters in order of rank, this is done in desecding order i.e 10,9,8 (not ascending 1,2,3)
